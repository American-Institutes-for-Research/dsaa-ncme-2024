# Publishing as a website

Add: if you don't want to deal with GitHub, you can output as PDF with the drawback of not being interactive.

`bookdown` can publish to PDF and EPUB (e-book, such as Kindle), but we are going to focus on outputting to gitbook (`HTML`) so that we can host our documentation book on the open web. Notice that we have the benefit of multiple output formats, a good accessibility support.

In the RStudio IDE Build pane, click on *Build Book > bookdown::gitbook*. Or, run `bookdown::render_book()` in the R console.

## Hosting on GitHub

Add: what is GitHub? brief overview, add link.

In order to make our new book public, we are going to host it on a website. Conveniently, GitHub has a built-in function to make any repository into a website. 

Open a browser and navigate to your repository online. On the Settings tab, under Pages, enable GitHub Pages.

The default name for a bookdown project directory is `/book`, but we see that GitHub only deploys `.html` files from inside directories named `/docs`. So we will rename our directory to `/docs`.

[describe how to setup GitHub Pages]

Wait up to 5 minutes for GitHub to publish your website. When you return to the GitHub Pages tab, GitHub should alert you that your website is available at some link similar to `your-username.github.io/repository-name`. 

Clicking on that link shows you your new website:
