# Adding interaction

The `bookdown` format is compatible with many JavaScript-based packages such as `shiny` and `plotly`. This means that we can create books where users can interact with graphs, dashboards, and more!

In this section we focus on `reactable`, a package that allows users to interactively sort and filter tables, similarly to an Excel workbook.
