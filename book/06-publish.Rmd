# Publishing as a website

`bookdown` can publish to PDF and EPUB (e-book, such as Kindle). Add: if you don't want to deal with GitHub, you can output as PDF with the drawback of not being interactive.

To host our documentation book on the open web, we can output to gitbook (`HTML`) so that we can. Notice that we have the benefit of multiple output formats, a good accessibility support.

```{r,echo=F,fig.cap="Build to gitbook from Build pane"}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/images/build.png')
```

In the RStudio IDE Build pane, click on *Build Book > bookdown::gitbook*. Or, run `bookdown::render_book()` in the R console.

## Hosting on GitHub

In order to make our new book public, we are going to host it on a website. Conveniently, GitHub ([what is GitHub?](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-git)) has a built-in function to make any repository into a website. 

Open a browser and navigate to your repository online. On the Settings tab, under Pages, enable GitHub Pages.

```{r,echo=F,fig.cap="Deploy GitHub Pages from the docs folder"}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/images/github-pages.png')
```

The default name for a bookdown project directory is `/book`, but GitHub only deploys `.html` files from inside the main directory of our repository. This repository is set to build `.html` files to the main directory: if you're starting from scratch, you can change this setting by editing `_bookdown.yml`:

```yaml
output_dir: "."
```

Wait up to 5 minutes for GitHub to publish your website. When you return to the GitHub Pages tab, GitHub should alert you that your website is available at some link similar to `your-username.github.io/repository-name`. 

Clicking on that link shows you your new website:

```{r,echo=F,fig.cap="HTML rendered website welcome page"}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/images/website.png')
```
