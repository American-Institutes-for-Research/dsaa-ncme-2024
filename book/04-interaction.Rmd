# Adding interaction

```{r, echo=F, warning=F}
source('setup.R')

t1 <- read_table('../resources/data/tables.xlsx',sheet="iep")
codebook <- read_table('../resources/data/codebook.xlsx',sheet=1)
```

The `bookdown` format is compatible with many JavaScript-based packages such as `shiny` and `plotly`. This means that we can create books where users can interact with graphs, dashboards, and more!

In this section we focus on `reactable`, a package that allows users to interactively sort and filter tables, similarly to an Excel workbook. 

[describe reactable and kable]

```{r}
kable2(
  t1, 
  caption = "Students with disabilities",
) %>%
  column_width(c(1,4)) %>%
  column_width(3, width = medium)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
reactable2(codebook,
           columns=list(
             Description=colDef(minWidth=120),
             Values=colDef(minWidth=80)
           ))
```
