# Crowd-sourced edits

Hosting on GitHub gives us more than just a domain to click on. It gives us the ability to solicit feedback in real time from users. 

Any reader of your website can click on the GitHub icon from your website to access the source code for your book. (Note: for any proprietary source data used in your bookdown, *do not commit data files to GitHub*. Instead store them locally on your own device.)

```{r,echo=F,fig.cap="Visit source repository by clicking on top-right GitHub icon"}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/images/visit-repo.png')
```

Users can now submit an issue via GitHub.

```{r,echo=F,fig.cap="Issues tab in GitHub"}
knitr::include_graphics('resources/images/issue.png')
```
